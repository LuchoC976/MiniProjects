This QRCode maker is made with the TKinter python module for GUI, 
it also uses de qrcode module form python as well, basically you
enter a URL into the box and the system verifies that is a genuine
URL, if it is, then it will show you the QRCode for that URL in a
new displayed window; if it is not, then the URL will be set to
a default URL, which is https://google.com
If you click on the checkbox to save the image of the QRCode, then
it will automatically be saved in your computer. 
The only issue with this feature is that it can only save 1 image
at a time, unless you change the names of the files, each time you
save a new image, the system will overwrite the previous saved image
But apart from that, it works fine
